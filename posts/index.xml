      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have stumbled on the birthday paradox. At first glace it does not seems more than some random probability dilemma, however this problem is relevant as a proxy to a number of real world case : for example in security the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;birthday attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
